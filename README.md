# PHYDA Proxy Map

Hosted: https://patrick-morrison.github.io/phyda_proxy_map/

R code to generate a map of the proxies used for the Paleo Hydrodynamics Data Assimilation product (PHYDA). Click on any proxy marker to see the data within it. I'm an archaeologist doing a PhD in how people responded to paleoclimate, and this is part of my learning process! Citation for the source paper here:
